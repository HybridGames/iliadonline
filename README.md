Iliad Engine
===========

Iliad is a 2D ORPG Game Engine for Ouya.

Background
-----------
It is inspired by [The Odyssey](http://odysseyclassic.com).
A small game engine written over a decade ago, in the now defunct, Visual Basic.
What it offers though, is a ready made platform to build real games.
In a single weekend, you could build a new world and on Monday have real people from all over the world playing.

This approachability, is what got me involved with it as a developer and game designer.
After a decade I've realized that it's the initial reason I want to work in games.
I enjoy being able to build a world, and particpate with others in enjoying it
*(or sometimes watching them not enjoying it).*

But The Odyssey is old.  Written in Visual Basic, which was replaced with .Net in 2002.
It's not as relevant, and not as approachable as it once was.
While I'm still involved in a couple of Odyssey projectes,
[Odyssey Reborn](http://odysseyreborn.com) and [Eventide Sun](http://eventidesun.com) 
(look for me as 
**"BaD"**
),
I feel it's too limited, and it's time to start something new.

The Project
-----------
The Iliad Engine is meant to be open and approachable.
That is the primary goal, to allow others to experience game design and development, with as little difficulty as possible.
It's focused on RPG games for a couple reasons.

- First, they're my favorite type of game to work on.
- Second, their complexity is actually in their content.
This allows for a much larger set of possible games, from the same code base.
Anyone can approach the engine, and make a completely unique game.

The second major goal, is for Iliad to be educational.
I'm not planning to write a text book or anything, but I hope an approachable game engine can inspire people.
Once inspired, I hope, with open source and collaborative tools like GitHub, that they can learn from it.
