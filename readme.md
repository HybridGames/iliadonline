#Iliad Online
##Goals
Our primary goal is to build an Online RPG engine that is accessible to player developers.  This means that while anyone can play Iliad, if you are so inclined you could develop your own game world for Iliad.  We hope to grow a community of player created worlds, all playable from a single client.  There are two distinct technical goals that will allow this to work:

1. The Iliad Client should be able to connect to any Iliad Server
2. The Iliad Server should be configurable, self initializing, and capable to providing necessary assets to the Iliad Client
